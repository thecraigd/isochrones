# isochrones
A script to create a network map showing distances which are an equal travel time away from a user-defined point.

My hope is to create a webapp using Flask or Django or something where you can enter a few details (location, mode of transport) and get a beautiful looking map showing you the different points you can get to in the same amount of time from that point.

Heavily indebted to / lifted from this excellent tutorial by Abdishakur: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-calculate-travel-time-for-any-location-in-the-world-56ce639511f (repo here: https://github.com/shakasom/isochronewithosmnx/tree/ab7e8415279235bf9cb3c50ac8770d418be66581). Apologies if I should have forked this directly or something, I'm still learning and mean no disrespect!
